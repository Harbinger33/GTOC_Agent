A first massive grid search is performed using a simplified dynamics model for the spacecraft and impulsive thrusts. The solutions are parameterized by the departure time at each leg and the duration of the transfer in increments of 15 days. A set of possible single leg transfers is computed using this approach. Then, these legs are patched together to form full missions. In a second step the missions coming from the above approach are locally optimised leg-by-leg by considering the low thrust characteristics of the engine. Finally, the software SOCS (Sparse Optimal Control Software Package) is used in order to optimize the full mission as a single optimization problem starting from the initial guesses obtained above. The gird search results are used again at this step to determine if additional flybys can be added to the mission.
